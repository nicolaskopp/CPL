# Climate Public License (CPL)

## Idea
The "Climate Public License" (CPL) is a free copyleft license for software and other works with a special requirement to combat climate change. The main principle of the CPL is that any commercial use of the work must be demonstrably climate-neutral. This means that companies using the software directly or indirectly for commercial purposes must conduct their business activities in a way that they do not cause any net CO2 emissions. This includes active measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and, if necessary, legitimate and verifiable offset measures.

Additionally, the use of the software must not result in products or sub-products that lead to an overall increase in CO2 emissions. The license also requires that companies commercially using the software provide annual public documentation of their climate neutrality in relation to the use of the software. This documentation must be detailed, transparent, and verifiable.

In short, the CPL aims to link the use of software with the fight against climate change by ensuring that the commercial use of the software does not contribute to climate change, but actively contributes to its combat.

## Why should projects and companies use the CPL?

Firstly, the CPL offers a strong public statement about a company's commitment to climate protection. In an era where customers and investors increasingly value sustainability and social responsibility, this could be a crucial factor in distinguishing themselves from the competition. Companies using the CPL could be seen as pioneers in their sector, which would strengthen their image and brand.

Moreover, the CPL could help companies achieve their own sustainability goals. Many companies are setting increasingly ambitious targets for reducing their CO2 emissions. Using software licensed under the CPL could be a practical step towards these goals, as it encourages companies to rethink their business practices and make them more sustainable.

In addition, the CPL could also offer financial benefits. Governments and other institutions are increasingly providing incentives for companies that demonstrably contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Using CPL-licensed software could make it easier for companies to take advantage of these incentives.

Last but not least, the CPL could also help create a community of like-minded companies and developers. This could lead to new partnerships, collaborations, and even innovations, as companies and developers work together to find solutions that are both commercially successful and climate-friendly.

Overall, the CPL could represent a win-win situation for companies looking to improve both their ecological and economic performance.

## Climate Responsibility Addendum (CRA) for existing licenses

The Climate Responsibility Addendum (CRA) is designed to be attached to existing licenses to introduce climate responsibility obligations. It does not alter the original permissions, limitations, or conditions of the underlying license but adds additional terms related to climate responsibility.

You can find it in this repo under the name [CRA](CRA).
