Climate Responsibility Addendum (CRA)

This Climate Responsibility Addendum (CRA) is designed to be attached to existing licenses to introduce climate responsibility obligations. It does not alter the original permissions, limitations, or conditions of the underlying license but adds additional terms related to climate responsibility.

1. Addendum Acceptance
   By using, modifying, or distributing the work covered under the original license and this Addendum, you accept and agree to be bound by the terms of both.

2. Climate Responsibility Obligation
   a. If you use the work for commercial purposes, directly or indirectly, you must operate your business in a climate-neutral manner. This includes actively reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with the use of the work and implementing verifiable and legitimate offset measures for any remaining emissions.
   b. Your use of the work must not directly or indirectly lead to an overall increase in CO2 emissions.
   c. You must provide public documentation annually demonstrating your climate neutrality in relation to the use of the work. This documentation must be detailed, transparent, and verifiable.

3. Redistribution with Addendum
   If you redistribute the work, you must include a copy of this Addendum along with the original license.

4. Termination for Non-Compliance
   If you fail to comply with the terms of this Addendum, your rights under this Addendum and the original open source license will terminate automatically.

5. Severability
   If any provision of this Addendum is deemed unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law or court decision, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render this Addendum unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and such provisions shall be changed and interpreted to best accomplish the objectives of such invalid or unenforceable provision within the limits of applicable law or court decision.

6. Survival of Obligations
   The obligations and responsibilities introduced by this Addendum shall survive any termination of the license.
